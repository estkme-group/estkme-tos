# The author of your site.
# Default: not set
# This will be used in HTML meta tags, the opengraph protocol and twitter
# cards.
# You can also set `author.email` if you want to publish this information.

# Relearn Theme
# These options are specific to the Relearn theme.

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Variants
# These options set your color variant.

# Used color variants.
# Default: "auto"
# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can
# - set a single value eg. "zen-light"
# - an array like [ "neon", "learn" ]
# - an array with options like [ { identifier = "neon" },{ identifier = "learn" } ]
# The last form allows to set further options for each variant.
# The `identifier` is mandatory. You can also set `name` which overrides the
# value displayed in the variant selector.
# If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: "relearn-bright",
# "relearn-light", "relearn-dark", "zen-light", "zen-dark", "neon", "learn",
# "blue", "green", "red". In addition you can use auto mode variants. See the
# docs for a detailed explaination.
# You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
# the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# General
# These options are defining general, non visual behavior.

# Avoid new asset URLs on build.
# Default: false
# By default JavaScript-files and CSS-files get a unique ID on each rebuild.
# This makes sure, the user always has the latest version and not some stale
# copy of his browser cache. Anyways, it can be desireable to turn this
# off in certain circumstances. For example if you have Hugo's dev server
# running. Also some proxies dislike this optimization.
disableAssetsBusting = false

# Avoid generator meta tags.
# Default: false
# Set this to true if you want to disable generation for generator meta tags
# of Hugo and the theme in your HTML head. In tihs case also don't forget to
# set Hugo's disableHugoGeneratorInject=true. Otherwise Hugo will generate a
# meta tag into your home page anyways.
disableGeneratorVersion = false

# Avoid unique IDs.
# Default: false
# In various situations the theme generates non stable unique ids to be used
# in HTML fragment links. This can be undesirable for example when testing
# the output for changes. If you disable the random id generation, the theme
# may not function correctly anymore.
disableRandomIds = false

# Multilanguage content.
# Default: not set
# If your pages contain further languages besides the main one used, add all
# those auxiliary languages here. This will create a search index with
# support for all used languages of your site.
# This is handy for example if you are writing in Spanish but have lots of
# source code on your page which typically uses English terminology.
additionalContentLanguage = [ "id" ]

# Additional code dependencies.
# Default: See hugo.toml of the theme
# The theme provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript and CSS
# dependencies on demand only if they are needed. This comes in handy if you
# want to add own shortcodes that depend on additional code to be loaded.
# See the docs how this works.
# [relearn.dependencies]

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Topbar

# disabled.
disableNextPrev = true

# The URL prefix to edit a page.
# Default: not set
# If set, an edit button will be shown in the topbar. If the button is hidden,
# also the keyboard shortcuts are disabled. The given URL is prepended to the
# relative file path of a the displayed page. The URL must end with a `/`.
# This is useful if you wnat to give the opportunity for people to create merge
#  request for your content.

# Menu
# These options modify the menu apperance.

# Default: false
# If shown, a Home button will appear below the search bar and the main menu.
# It links to your the home page of the current language.

# Default: "weight"
# Submenus can be ordered by "weight", "title", "linktitle", "modifieddate",

# Hugo's default sort order). This can be overridden in the pages frontmatter.
ordersectionsby = "weight"

# The initial expand state of submenus.
# Default: not set
# This controls whether submenus will be expanded (true), or collapsed (false)
# in the menu. If not set, the first menu level is set to false, all others

# regardless of this option.

# Shows expander for submenus.

# tree view and a clickable expander is set in front of the entry.
# This can be overridden in the page's frontmatter.
collapsibleMenu = true

# Shows checkmarks for visited pages of the main menu.
# Default: false
# This also causes the display of the `Clear History` entry in the lower part
# of the menu to remove all checkmarks. The checkmarks will also been removed
# if you regenerate your site as the ids are not stable.
showVisitedLinks = false

# Hide heading above the shortcut menu.
# Default: false

# documentation how to do this.

# Hidden pages
# These options configure how hidden pages are treated.
# A page flagged as hidden, is only removed from the main menu if you are

# search results and term pages.
breadcrumbSeparator = ">"

# Hide the root breadcrumb.

# by removing this from your breadcrumb.
disableRootBreadcrumb = true

# Hide breadcrumbs term pages.
# Default: false

# By default lines of code blocks wrap around if the line is too long to be
